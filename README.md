# DU2 - Exercise 2 - HTML Tables - Trip table

Create a file called trip-table.html with the required HTML markup. 

Markup the table content below with these tags: table, tr, th, td, thead, tfoot, tbody and caption.

Be sure to properly use the HTML attributes colspan and rowspan for cells that obviously span multiple cells. Notice that the table has two header rows, three body/content rows and zero footer rows, so you should use the most appropriate tags to identify these areas.

Upload the repository to GitHub and create a README.md to explain the repository with an image of the table you have to create.
